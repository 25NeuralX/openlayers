title: Vector Labels - Justify Text
shortdesc: Example of text justification within a label.
docs: >
  This example showcases how the text can be justified within the label box.
  By default, the text is justified according to the `textAlign` option.
  However, this option justifies the label itself according to the setting.
  If one wants to change this behavior, it is possible to use the `justify` text style option.
